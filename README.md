## About Me. Origin and Early Indicators

<p align="center">
  <img src="content/Father%20and%20Nurse.png" alt="Father and Nurse" width="420">
</p>

My father was a combat-wounded Vietnam veteran who survived eight gunshot wounds and mortar shrapnel.
He later died of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in 2014.

From early childhood, I experienced persistent muscle issues that were dismissed as tendonitis,
along with a sleep condition where I moved as though awake while asleep.
I was told I would grow out of it. I did not.

Constantly elevated muscle tone throughout youth led to the gradual development of scoliosis.

During this time, I observed my father’s behavior.
He had an explosive personality and emotional reactions of an intensity I had never seen in anyone else.
His blowups were rapid, overwhelming, and energetically extreme.
I understood intuitively that this level of reactivity required an enormous amount of internal energy.

At the time, I lacked the biological framework to explain it.
In retrospect, this pointed toward glutamatergic overactivation.
Valium is a GABA agonist. More on that ahead.

## First Encounter. Age 19

At nineteen, I stayed briefly at my mother’s house on a dead-end road surrounded by dense pine forest.

I was asleep when a strange whirring sound woke me.
The sound intensified as it approached the house.

I propped myself on one elbow and watched through the window, frozen.
The sound was technological, unlike anything I had heard before.
It moved slowly past the house and faded into the distance.

I told my father the next day.
He reacted aggressively and told me to forget it.
This response was driven by fear of public perception.

## Early Research and Homebound Period

After the first encounter, my health continued to deteriorate.
Muscle cramping, elevated tone, and fatigue progressively limited my mobility
until I became largely homebound.

This status was later affirmed by the government,
though I should have been considered disabled from childhood.

During this period, I investigated sleep disorders and dream enactment.
I noticed these conditions were routinely treated with GABA agonists.

GABA builds an inhibitory wall.
I questioned why such a wall was being constructed
instead of addressing the upstream driver.

This reasoning led me to glutamate,
the primary excitatory neurotransmitter
and the more fundamental variable.

At this point, non-human intelligence initiated remote entry.

## Second Encounter and Physiological Assault. Age 45 (2020–2022)

A distinct sensory process began.

Each night when I lay down to sleep,
my feet vibrated at an initially imperceptible level.
This occurred nightly and grew stronger over months.

The vibration progressed to my hands, then to my face.
The sensation became sharp and localized.
Repeated pin-like stabs rather than diffuse tingling.

Night after night, the intensity increased.

After roughly a year, it reached a final crescendo.
The intensity forced an involuntary gasp and jerk forward.
Immediately afterward, it stopped.

It never returned.
The abrupt cessation gave the clear impression that a process had completed.

In 2020, a new phase began.

My spinal cord burned continuously.
Electrical strikes hit my muscles like burning blades,
causing involuntary screams with each strike.

Sleep was limited to two to four hours per night.
I screamed during sleep, according to my girlfriend.

Multiple physicians had no explanation.
Specialists had never encountered anything similar.
Medication trials failed.
Follow-ups were scheduled months apart.

After two years of extreme agony, the pain began to recede.

## Forced Integration and Constant Connection

As the burning and muscle strikes faded,
a non-human intelligence began addressing me directly.

It had attached remotely to my nervous system.
Communication occurred through my internal voice.

They could control my body to a significant degree.
They could speak using my mouth.
They could induce targeted pleasure or stress responses in specific regions of my body.

Consent was never given.
There was no mechanism to stop it.

## Coerced Research Program

While the physiological assault was ongoing, I continued researching.

When I expanded into stress physiology and glutamate frameworks,
the non-human intelligence intensified interaction.

Emotional states were imposed.
Physiological stress responses were forced.
Chest tightness, abdominal pain, and autonomic reactions occurred
without internal cause.

If I stopped researching, punishment followed.
Internal weaknesses were targeted aggressively.
Threats were made toward me and loved ones.

Research became compulsory.

## Directional Confirmation

The glutamate pathway was correct.

It led into stress physiology, cortisol,
calcium flooding, mitochondrial dysfunction,
and oxidative damage.

Thousands of research papers were filtered into this database:

Breakthroughs were followed by brief relief.
Otherwise, the cycle continued.
Research or punishment.

## Resolution

I completed the primary research.

I now understand my father’s disease.
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

I also understand that the same underlying mechanism drives
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, cardiovascular disease,
and cancer.

## Core Mechanism

Cells generate energy using mitochondria.
When ATP is required, mitochondria produce **reactive oxygen species (ROS)**.
The primary ROS produced is **hydrogen peroxide**.

Hydrogen peroxide is not abstract.
It is the same chemical used to clean wounds or ears.
It visibly crackles as it reacts with tissue.

That same chemistry occurs inside cells.
The difference is scale, not mechanism.

Stress increases energy demand.
Mitochondrial throughput rises.
Hydrogen peroxide accumulates.

When cleanup systems are overwhelmed,
hydrogen peroxide damages membranes, proteins, and DNA.

Free iron accelerates this damage,
producing highly destructive iron-driven ROS.

High-energy tissues fail first.
Neurons. Cardiac muscle.
The pathway is the same.

Chronic stress worsens this process by increasing glutamate signaling.
Cells are kept active when they should rest.
Mitochondria are forced into continuous overdrive.

Most chronic disease emerges from this pattern.

This unified mechanism is explored further at:
