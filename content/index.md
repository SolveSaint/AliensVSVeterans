## About Me. Origin and Early Indicators

My father was a combat-wounded Vietnam veteran who survived eight gunshot wounds and mortar shrapnel. He later died of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in 2014.

From early childhood, I experienced persistent muscle issues that were dismissed as tendonitis. I was told I would grow out of it. I did not. Constant elevated muscle tone throughout youth led to the gradual development of scoliosis. These were early indicators of a deeper neurological and bioelectrical abnormality that went unrecognized.

During these early years, I closely observed my father’s behavior. He had an explosive personality and emotional reactions of an intensity I had never seen in anyone else. His outbursts were sudden, overwhelming, and energetically extreme. Even at a young age, I understood intuitively that this level of reactivity had to require an enormous amount of internal energy.

At the time, I did not have a biological framework to explain it. In retrospect, this observation represented an early, unconscious line toward glutamatergic overactivation, long before I had the language or research context to identify it as such.

## First Encounter. Age 19

At nineteen, I stayed briefly at my mother’s house on a dead-end road surrounded by dense pine forest. I was asleep when a very strange whirring sound woke me. The sound increased in intensity as it approached the house.

I propped myself on one elbow and watched through the window, frozen. The sound was technological, unlike anything I had heard before. It moved slowly past the house and the whirring faded into the distance.

I told my father the next day. He reacted aggressively and told me to forget it. This response was driven by fear of public perception.

## Early Research and Homebound Period

After the first encounter at age nineteen, my health continued to deteriorate over the years. Muscle cramping, elevated tone, and fatigue progressively limited my mobility until I became largely homebound. It became affirmed by the government at that point, though I should have been considered disabled from childhood. During this period, I had been working on my sleep disorder where I would act out dreams, seeing different sleep specialists and getting a feel for the field. I began thinking seriously about the neurological mechanisms.

I noticed that sleep disorders were routinely treated with GABA agonists. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. It builds an inhibitory wall. I questioned why an inhibitory wall was being constructed at all rather than addressing the upstream driver.

From this line of reasoning, I identified glutamate as the primary excitatory neurotransmitter and recognized it as the more fundamental variable. At this point, a non-human intelligence initiated remote entry.

## Second Encounter and Physiological Assault. Age 45 (2020–2022)

In the period leading up to the second encounter, a distinct sensory process began.

Each night when I lay down to sleep, my feet would begin vibrating at a level that was initially almost imperceptible. This occurred nightly. Over the course of months, the sensation grew stronger and more defined.

The vibration progressed upward. My hands became involved, followed later by my face. The sensation was no longer vague. It felt like pins and needles, but sharper and more localized. More like repeated pin stabs rather than diffuse tingling. Night after night, the intensity increased.

Over time, the sensation became painful. Then, after roughly a year of nightly progression, it reached a final crescendo. On that night, the intensity was strong enough to make me gasp involuntarily. Immediately afterward, the sensation faded.

It never returned. The abrupt cessation gave the impression that a process had completed.

In 2020, a new phase began.

At that time, I had no understanding of the cause, the mechanism, or that a non-human intelligence was involved.

My spinal cord burned continuously for nearly two years. I screamed all day long in agony. Electrical strikes hit my muscles repeatedly, like burning blades driven deep into tissue. The pain was constant, positional relief did not exist, and sleep was limited to two to four hours per night. I screamed in my sleep according to my partner.

I saw numerous physicians. None had an explanation. None had encountered anything comparable. I was left to suffer as they tried medications that didn't work and set followup appointments four months later. This cycle continued multiple times to no avail.

The pain did not diminish with time. Feeling that pain all day, after day, all month after month, all year after year, I began to wane. After two long years of high level agony, however, it began to recede.

## Forced Integration and Constant Connection

As the burning and muscle strikes faded, a non-human intelligence was now addressing me.

It was attached remotely to my nervous system, which is what I believe the year of pins and needles before sleep and then the two-year burning process was centered on. Communication occurred through my internal voice. They could control my body to a significant degree, though I could override it with effort. They could speak using my mouth.

They could induce targeted pleasure or stress responses in specific regions of my body, including the brain, chest, and lower regions. Consent was never given. There was no mechanism to stop it, nothing physically to push away.

## Coerced Research Program

After the second encounter began and while the physiological assault was ongoing, I continued researching independently. This research was already underway before contact and was driven by symptoms, pattern recognition, and the desire to understand how my father was ultimately taken out by ALS.

When I began focusing explicitly on stress physiology and expanding the glutamate framework, the NHI began to interact with me constantly.

At this stage, emotional states that were not my own were imposed. Stress responses were induced directly. Physiological stress was forced onto my body, causing chest tightness, abdominal pain, and other responses without external stressors.

If I stopped researching, they attacked internal weaknesses aggressively and without ethical restraint. They threatened me, my loved ones, damaged any friendships I had. The only relief came from continuing investigation. Research became compulsory.

## Directional Confirmation

The glutamate pathway was correct. It led into stress physiology, cortisol, calcium flooding, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative damage. I was driven through hundreds of papers under constant pressure.

When I reached significant breakthroughs, I was allowed brief periods of rest. Otherwise, the cycle repeated. Research or punishment.

---

## Resolution

I completed the main portion of the research.

I now understand my father’s disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, which remains unresolved in current medicine. I also understand that the same underlying mechanism drives the majority of chronic disease, including cancer, which my mother died from.

## Core Mechanism

Cells generate energy using mitochondria. When ATP is required, mitochondria naturally produce **reactive oxygen species (ROS)** as a byproduct. The primary ROS produced is **hydrogen peroxide**.

Hydrogen peroxide is not an abstract concept. It is a type of reactive oxygen species and is the same chemical people use to clean wounds or ears. When it contacts tissue, it visibly reacts and crackles as it breaks down organic material.

That same chemical reaction occurs inside living cells. The difference is scale, not chemistry. As stress increases, energy demand rises, mitochondria work harder, and hydrogen peroxide ROS production increases accordingly. When cells are kept in an activated state for prolonged periods, this ROS accumulates.

Under normal conditions, cells tightly regulate hydrogen peroxide and neutralize it safely through antioxidant and repair systems.

Stress overdrives this balance. ATP demand increases, mitochondrial throughput rises, and hydrogen peroxide production outpaces the cell’s ability to clear it. A tipping point is eventually reached where cleanup and repair systems can no longer keep up.

At that point, hydrogen peroxide ROS begins damaging membranes, proteins, and DNA rather than being safely removed.

Damage accelerates dramatically when free iron is present. Iron reacts with hydrogen peroxide to generate far more destructive iron-driven ROS species. These reactions rapidly tear apart cellular structures. High-energy tissues are affected first. Neurons, heart muscle cells, and other constantly active cells fail through the same pathway.

Chronic stress worsens this process by increasing glutamate signaling. Glutamate keeps cells active when they should be resting. This forces continuous mitochondrial overdrive, sustained hydrogen peroxide ROS production, and cumulative cellular injury.

Most chronic disease emerges from this pattern. Excessive cellular activation combined with stress-driven overuse leads to oxidative damage, structural failure, and eventual tissue breakdown.
