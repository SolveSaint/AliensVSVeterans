## About Me. Origin.
![[Father and Nurse.png|500]]

My father was a combat-wounded Vietnam veteran who survived eight gunshot wounds and mortar shrapnel. He later died of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis in 2014.

From early childhood, I experienced persistent muscle issues that were dismissed as tendonitis and a sleep issue where I moved around like I was awake while sleeping. I was told I would grow out of it. I did not. Constant elevated muscle tone throughout youth led to the gradual development of scoliosis.

During this time, I observed my father’s behavior. He had an explosive personality and emotional reactions at an intensity I hadn't seen in anyone else. His blowups were quick to build, environmentally overwhelming, and energetically extreme. I understood intuitively that this level of reactivity had to require an enormous amount of internal energy.

At the time, I did not have a biological framework to explain it, but I thought my father should most likely be on Valium or similar. In retrospect, this observation represented an early line toward glutamatergic overactivation, as Valium is a GABA agonist. More on that ahead.

## First Encounter. Age 19
![[AVSV - Age 19 First Encounter.png|300]]

At nineteen, I stayed briefly at my mother’s house on a dead-end road surrounded by dense pine forest. I was asleep when a very strange whirring sound woke me. The sound increased in intensity as it approached the house.

I propped myself on one elbow and watched through the window, frozen. The sound was technological, unlike anything I had heard before. It moved slowly past the house and the whirring faded into the distance.

I told my father the next day. He reacted aggressively and told me to forget it. This response was driven by fear of public perception.

## Early Research and Homebound Period

After the first encounter at age nineteen, my health continued to deteriorate over the years. Muscle cramping, elevated tone, and fatigue progressively limited my mobility until I became largely homebound. It became affirmed by the government at that point, though I should have been considered disabled from childhood. During this period, I had been looking at sleep disorder where and dream enactment, as well as seeing different sleep specialists and getting a feel for the field. I began thinking seriously about the neurological mechanisms.

I noticed that sleep disorders were routinely treated with GABA agonists. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. It builds an inhibitory wall. I questioned why an inhibitory wall was being constructed at all rather than addressing the upstream driver.

From this line of reasoning, I identified glutamate as the primary excitatory neurotransmitter and recognized it as the more fundamental variable. At this point, a non-human intelligence initiated remote entry.

## Second Encounter and Physiological Assault. Age 45

In the period leading up to being controlled, a distinct sensory process began.

Each night when I lay down to sleep, my feet would begin vibrating at a level that was initially almost imperceptible. This occurred nightly. I mentioned it to my girl friend and couldn't figure out what it was. Over the course of months, the sensation grew stronger and more defined.

The vibration progressed to my hands. Again this lasted for a while, building up in strength every night.  Then it covered my face in the same manner. The sensation was no longer vague. It felt like pins and needles, but sharper and more localized. Like repeated pin stabs rather than diffuse tingling. Night after night, the intensity kept increasing.

The sensations became painful. After roughly a year of nightly progression, it reached a final crescendo. The intensity was so strong that it made me gasp out loud involuntarily and jerk forward. But then immediately afterward, the sensation faded.

It never returned. **The abrupt cessation gave the very strong impression that some kind of process had been completed**.

Then a new phase began. An agony producing phase.

At that time, I had no understanding of the cause, or the mechanism. I assumed it had to be due to my condition even though this was severely abnormal from what I knew of ALS.

My spinal cord itself burned horribly and continuously, unrelenting. Electrical strikes hit my muscles repeatedly, like burning blades driven deep into tissue, causing me to scream in agony with each strike. The pain was was so high that almost no one would be able to understand it. Positional relief did not exist. I slept when exhaustion forced it and was limited to two to four hours per night. I screamed in my sleep according to my girl friend, but remained exhaustively sleeping at times.

I saw numerous doctors. None had an explanation. Specialists as well, none had encountered anything similar. So that left me to suffer as they tried medications that didn't work. Then set a follow-up appointment for after four more months of agony. This cycle continued multiple times to without a solution.

The pain didn't diminish. Feeling that pain all day long, day after day, month after month, and into year after year, I began to wane. But finally, after two long years of the most intense agony you can imagine, it began to recede.

## Forced Integration and Constant Connection

As the burning and muscle strikes faded, a non-human intelligence was now addressing me directly.

It had attached remotely to my nervous system, which is what I believe the year of pins and needles before sleep and then the two-year burning process was centered on. 

Communication occurred through my internal voice. They could control my body to a significant degree, though I could override it with effort. They could speak using my mouth.

They could induce targeted pleasure or stress response in specific regions of my body, including the brain, chest, stomach, and lower regions. Consent was never given. There was no mechanism to stop it, nothing to physically push away.

## Coerced Research Program

After the second encounter began and while the physiological assault was ongoing, I continued researching. I was already underway long before contact and was driven by my symptoms, pattern recognition, and the desire to understand how my father was ultimately taken out by ALS.

When I began progressing into stress physiology and expanding the glutamate framework, the NHI began to interact with me in a constant barrage-like manner.

It pushed emotional states onto to me that I couldn't counter in any way. I could feel my own state and the foreign state simultaneously. Stress responses were induced that weren't mine. Physiological response was forced onto me, causing chest tightness, abdominal pain, and other responses without internal stressors from myself in any way.

It would take control of my body and force me to spin in circles in front of my girl friend to show it's control. It threatened to make me look like a fool in public by taking control or putting the pleasure beam on me to force me to make sound. It threatened to disrupt my speech or speak in ways that would cause me problems.

If I stopped researching, they attacked internal weaknesses aggressively and without any ethical restraint. And let me reiterate for everyone, no ethics in any fashion. It threatened me, my loved ones, and damaged any friendships I had. The only relief came from continuing investigation. Research became compulsory.

## Directional Confirmation

The glutamate pathway was correct. It led into stress physiology, cortisol, calcium flooding, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative damage. I was driven through thousands of research papers, filtered to [this set](https://solvesaint.github.io/Biolectrics-Wiki/Research-Paper-Database), under constant pressure.

When I reached significant breakthroughs, I was allowed brief periods of rest. Otherwise, the cycle repeated. Research or punishment.

## Resolution

I completed the main portion of the research.

I now understand my father’s disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, which remains unresolved in current medicine. I also understand that the same underlying mechanism drives the majority of chronic disease, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Cardiovascular disease, and cancer, which my mother died from.

## Core Mechanism

Cells generate energy using mitochondria. When ATP is required, mitochondria naturally produce **reactive oxygen species (ROS)** as a byproduct. The primary ROS produced is **hydrogen peroxide**.

Hydrogen peroxide is not an abstract concept. It is a type of reactive oxygen species and is the same chemical people use to clean wounds or ears. When it contacts tissue, it visibly reacts and crackles as it breaks down organic material.

That same chemical reaction occurs inside living cells. The difference is scale, not chemistry. As stress increases, energy demand rises, mitochondria work harder, and hydrogen peroxide ROS production increases accordingly. When cells are kept in an activated state for prolonged periods, this ROS accumulates.

Under normal conditions, cells tightly regulate hydrogen peroxide and neutralize it safely through antioxidant and repair systems.

Stress overdrives this balance. ATP demand increases, mitochondrial throughput rises, and hydrogen peroxide production outpaces the cell’s ability to clear it. A tipping point is eventually reached where cleanup and repair systems can no longer keep up.

At that point, hydrogen peroxide ROS begins damaging membranes, proteins, and DNA rather than being safely removed.

Damage accelerates dramatically when free iron is present. Iron reacts with hydrogen peroxide to generate far more destructive iron-driven ROS species. These reactions rapidly tear apart cellular structures. High-energy tissues are affected first. Neurons, heart muscle cells, and other constantly active cells fail through the same pathway.

Chronic stress worsens this process by increasing glutamate signaling. Glutamate keeps cells active when they should be resting. This forces continuous mitochondrial overdrive, sustained hydrogen peroxide ROS production, and cumulative cellular injury.

Most chronic disease emerges from this pattern. Excessive cellular activation combined with stress-driven overuse leads to oxidative damage, structural failure, and eventual tissue breakdown.

This unified mechanism is explored in more depth at the [Biolectrics-Wiki](https://solvesaint.github.io/Biolectrics-Wiki/)
