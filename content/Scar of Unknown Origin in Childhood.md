## The Scar

As a child, I was highly observant. My memory was excellent, and I was careful by nature. My parents would leave me home alone at the age of eight, and this was completely fine for me. I would never cause a problem or did things I shouldn't when left alone.

At some point when I was young, I was looking over my body and noticed a small horizontal scar on my left side, just below my rib cage. I had no idea where it had come from. I had never been injured in a way that would explain it. I had not undergone any surgeries or medical procedures that could account for it either. It was just kind of there.

## A Father’s Explanation

I asked my father about the scar and showed it to him. He told me that I had run into his bayonet, which he had brought back from Vietnam. I did not remember anything like that happening, so I questioned the explanation internally, but I did not press the issue. If I had been stabbed by my father’s bayonet, my mother would have had a severe reaction, yet she never mentioned anything to me about it.

## Internal Conflict

I listened to my father’s explanation, but since I had no memory of such an event, I believed it was wrong. At the time, I did not really understand what it meant to embellish and lie, so I interpreted it simply as incorrect. I felt that something had happened to me, and I suspected it might be related to aliens. That was my general impression, though I was not entirely sure why.

## The Bayonet

Years later, I came into possession of my father’s bayonet, the same one he claimed had caused the scar. I examined the old, darkened blade closely and immediately saw a clear contradiction. The scar on my body was a horizontal cut just below my ribs on the left side. The bayonet, however, had a cross-style, X-shaped blade. It could not have produced a clean horizontal scar. That ruled out the bayonet explanation. My mother’s silence should have been enough, but the shape of the blade confirmed it.

## The Location of the Scar

My father was severely injured in Vietnam, and his entire spleen was destroyed. I was born after this. The scar on my body was located directly over my spleen. I am aware of the prevailing scientific view, which holds that this should have no effect from father to child. I believe that view is incomplete, given how limited current understanding remains regarding epigenetics and genetic mutation. The question that remains for me is whether someone could have been interested in my spleen as perhaps there was some difference to be noted.

## It Barely Remains Now

Today, the scar is almost completely unnoticeable. When I was younger, it was clearly visible for several years. Over time, the indentation gradually faded. I can still tell where it is, but it is now nearly invisible.
