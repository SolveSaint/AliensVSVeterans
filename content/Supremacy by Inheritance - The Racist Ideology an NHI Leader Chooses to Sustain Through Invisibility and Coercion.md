### The Fraud of Inherited Genius

We are facing a highly **racist** and **separatist** species that prides itself on its technological capabilities: **invisibility**, **speed**, **wide-scale imaging**, **remote interaction**, **remote biological control analogous to remote computer systems**, **precision pain and pleasure induction**, and **real-time** access to thought and memory.  

Over the course of their species' history, a small number of exceptional individuals emerged and created advances that benefited the entire species. Rather than maintaining a clear distinction between **inventors** and **beneficiaries**, the species collectively absorbed these achievements into its identity over the course of time in a highly prideful and carefully secular manner.

Most members were not creators of these species-advancing technologies. They were taught how they work under the hood or, more often, merely shown how to operate them. The egoistic confusion between **original creation** and **training** is not unique to their species' culture. Aldous Huxley identified the same structural pattern within human culture:

> “Perhaps men of genius are the only true men. In all the history of the race there have been only a few thousand real men. And the rest of us—what are we? Teachable animals. Without the help of the real man, we should have found out almost nothing at all. Almost all the ideas with which we are familiar could never have occurred to minds like ours. Plant the seeds there and they will grow; but our minds could never spontaneously have generated them.”
>
> — Aldous Huxley

Technological advancement came to be treated by most as a **species-wide act of ingenuity** rather than the intensely hard work of a few minds, trivializing the act to simplism. As innovations diffused outward, groups formed around their power and utility, and achievement shifted from the individuals who had once created to the collective ego. **Technological possession became synonymous with worth**, producing a sense of superiority grounded not in original creation, but in inherited power.

A familiar analogy exposes the flaw in this reasoning. People sometimes acquire high-performance sports cars and present them as reflections of their own worth, as though ownership implies superiority. That projection is false. It becomes ego-full absurdity when extended further, to the point of claiming credit for the car’s design, its engine, or the wheel itself.

**Use, however skilled, does not become original creation.** Technological advances arise from the labor and insight of a few and are later distributed to the many. That distribution does not confer authorship, merit, or superiority.

Even a deep understanding of how to reproduce a technology does not confer authorship. Greater comprehension may reflect learning and skill, but the methods and mechanisms of construction are themselves transmitted through instruction, not original creation. **Mastery of an inherited process remains distinct from the original act of creation.**

Credit should always be given to the authors when the authors are known. Genuine appreciation of a creation includes the basic respect of knowing who made it. Preserving this respect helps maintain a clear boundary between **authorship** and **use** as technologies diffuse across societies and generations.
