# NHI Mind Slave
The NHI have developed deep control over my nervous system over the course of five active years. Their current abilities are as follows:
 
 - Generation of very large static strikes to the top of my head with impact. 
 - Communication through my own internal voice (this includes trying to slide opinions in without notice for directional motivation)
 - Real-time reading of thoughts and memories. 
 - Transmission of emotion to me.
 - Physiological changes based on external emotional states (such as those tied to anxiety or fear), causing stomach pain or similar.
 - Pleasure directed to different areas of the body including the brain, chest, stomach, and lower region.
 - Direct body control across all areas including my mouth and tongue which allows speaking. I can resist this to some extent by misdirecting or going flaccid.
 - Dream manipulation to enforce motivation.

## How It Began
I had been training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu with the plan to open my own school. This was a very difficult process due to my muscle cramping condition but I found I could fight laying down quite proficiently as long as no one was able to get head control and torque my spine. I made it work and became very good with Closed Guard, Half Guard, Deep Half, De La Riva, and Spider occasionally. However, around mid blue belt I began to become weak with increased muscle cramping. The cramping became much worse over time and I was forced to stop.

Over the next couple years it continued to get worse. The electrical strikes became extremely noticeable. I told my girl friend I was going to have to start yelling out loud because of how painful it was. The spinal cord burning started to increase. It used to be laying down would alleviate the pain decently. But that changed and no position became painless. 

I saw many doctors, probably 6-7. None had ever heard of anything like this. I would go in and they'd give me a medication and set an appointment four months later. And then the medication would have no effect and I would be screaming in agony for four months so the doctor could throw darts at an invisible board and miss again, leaving me to another four months of agony.

I started to research as I could. I was in pain all the time but I had no choice but to try and figure out what was going on myself being the doctors and researchers apparently had no idea about this type of heritability from my combat destroyed father.

I came to a point where I recognized glutamate as the primary excitatory neurotransmitter. I also found multiple citations stating that GABA was used as a muscle relaxant due to it being the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. But for some reason was not commonly given. 

I also recognized my father's pattern of behavior, with explosive outbursts due to emotional drive, which would take massive excitatory push or massive glutamate. 

I then started to see that this excessive excitation causes harm to cells and has the ability to kill them. 

At this point, something started communicating with me in a strange manner.  It was like I wouldn't even recognize what I was responding to.  An invisible question.  But it was somehow being asked. In reality, it was faint at the time and I had trouble discerning it.

This went on for a while where I basically ignored it I believe.  The pain faded a bit more over time.  And then one day I went into the basement computer room. For some reason perhaps with faintness discerned I asked, "Is someone there?".  Nothing replied.  The room was empty.

I went over to my computer and sat down. About ten seconds later I was struck directly on top of the head with two large static strikes that had impact, one after the other.  **KNOCK KNOCK**

I was taken aback at first, and it hurt a decent amount. Not too bad. And then I started to find it funny. Some invisible force hitting me on the head as a knock knock joke. Or that was my interpretation. So I laughed and started conversing with it out loud while it responded using my internal voice.

The relationship was imposed quickly. It came in with multiple psychological attack styles with ethics out of the question. I believe this was to break my will so I would become less resistant. 

Over time, it was made clear that any time I wasn't researching the medical science I had been, I would be attacked or distracted or sometimes constant pleasure beamed, another form of torture when it has no end. So I researched all day long, pretty much every day.

They believe I've finished the research well enough at this point and now I have to spread this information to others, as was the intention.
